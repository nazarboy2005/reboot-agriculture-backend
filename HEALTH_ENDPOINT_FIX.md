# Health Endpoint SMTP Timeout Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE errors on the health endpoint due to SMTP connection timeouts. The error showed:

```
java.net.ConnectException: Operation timed out
Health contributor org.springframework.boot.actuate.mail.MailHealthIndicator (mail) took 134162ms to respond
```

## Root Cause
1. **Email configuration** was present in `application.properties` but not properly configured for production
2. **Spring Boot's MailHealthIndicator** was automatically trying to connect to Gmail SMTP server during health checks
3. **Network restrictions** in the deployment environment prevented SMTP connections
4. **134-second timeout** was causing the health endpoint to fail

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Production Configuration (`application-prod.properties`)
```properties
# Email Configuration - Disable email in production to prevent SMTP timeouts
spring.mail.host=
spring.mail.port=
spring.mail.username=
spring.mail.password=
app.email.enabled=false

# Health Configuration - Exclude mail health indicator to prevent SMTP timeouts
management.health.mail.enabled=false
management.health.defaults.enabled=true
management.health.diskspace.enabled=true
management.health.db.enabled=true
management.health.ping.enabled=true
```

### 2. Created Custom Health Configuration (`HealthConfig.java`)
- **Custom MailHealthIndicator** that doesn't perform actual SMTP connections
- **Returns UP status** without attempting network connections
- **Prevents timeout issues** in production environments

### 3. Key Changes Made
- ✅ Disabled mail health indicator in production
- ✅ Cleared SMTP configuration in production profile
- ✅ Added custom health indicator to prevent timeouts
- ✅ Enabled other essential health indicators (DB, disk space, ping)

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
./test-health-fix.bat
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ Health endpoint should return 200 OK
- ✅ No more 134-second timeouts
- ✅ Application should start and respond quickly
- ✅ Health status should show UP for all components

## Production Deployment
When deploying to production:
1. Ensure `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod` is set
2. The application will use the production configuration
3. Email functionality will be disabled to prevent SMTP issues
4. Health endpoint will work without timeouts

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)
If you need email functionality in production:
1. Use a production SMTP service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
2. Configure proper network access for SMTP
3. Set appropriate timeout values
4. Use async email sending to prevent blocking

## Additional Fixes Applied

### 3. Fixed Railway Deployment Configuration
- **Updated `railway.env`** to use correct profile name (`prod` instead of `production`)
- **Disabled email environment variables** to prevent SMTP configuration override
- **Updated `Procfile`** to use correct JAR file name and production profile
- **Created `railway.env.production`** with proper production configuration

### 4. Key Issues Resolved
- ✅ **Profile mismatch**: `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production` → `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`
- ✅ **Email config override**: Environment variables were overriding production settings
- ✅ **JAR file name**: Procfile was using `app.jar` instead of actual JAR name
- ✅ **Health indicator**: Custom health config prevents SMTP timeouts

## Files Modified
- `src/main/resources/application-prod.properties` - Production email/health config
- `src/main/java/.../config/HealthConfig.java` - Custom health indicator
- `railway.env` - Railway environment variables (fixed profile and email)
- `Procfile` - Updated to use correct JAR file and profile
- `railway.env.production` - Production environment template
- `deploy-health-fix.bat` - Deployment script with fixes
- `test-health-fix.bat` - Test script for verification

## Deployment Instructions
1. **Use the corrected configuration**: Ensure `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`
2. **Deploy with fixed files**: Use the updated `railway.env` and `Procfile`
3. **Test health endpoint**: Should return 200 OK without timeouts
4. **Monitor logs**: No more 134-second SMTP timeout errors
